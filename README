Just a quick mashup as it is right now to provide basic functionallty.

The main reason this arose was to allow for me to enter the logs into SQL so 
I can better run queries against that data.

Connects to the same database as hey0's mod, 'minecraft' plan on making that 
adjustable. 

Currently requires that the logs be output to a master file to parse correctly.

default.css contains all of the styles.

A hash is created from the log line and used as the primary key in the table.
This allows for you to run the same inject on the same log without worry about any duplicate entries.
This also removes duplicate entries for commands that are spammed to the console within that second.

Has functions to:
Create the 'log' table
Drop the 'log' table
Clear the 'log' table
Inject the log data into the 'log' table
Display the log data FROM the 'log' table
