Just a quick mashup as it is right now to provide basic functionallty.

The main reason this arose was to allow for me to enter the logs into SQL so 
I can better run queries against that data.

Connects to the same database as hey0's mod, 'minecraft' plan on making that 
adjustable. 

Has functions to:
Create the 'log' table
Drop the 'log' table
Clear the 'log' table
Inject the log data into the 'log' table
Display the log data FROM the 'log' table
